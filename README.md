This is a beginner-friendly command-line application built using Go (Golang). It allows users to create and manage simple bills for cafes, restaurants, or any small business — all through a terminal interface.

It’s a hands-on project that helps you learn Go while building something real: handling input, formatting output, working with files, and structuring Go code into reusable components.
