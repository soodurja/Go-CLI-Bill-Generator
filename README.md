# 🧾 Go CLI Bill Generator

This is a beginner-friendly command-line application built using **Go (Golang)**. It allows users to create and manage simple bills for cafes, restaurants, or any small business — all through a terminal interface.

It’s a hands-on, real-world project aimed at helping you learn Go from the ground up, including how to structure your code, use core language features, and handle files.

To verify that Go is correctly installed, open your terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```

If installed properly, this will show your Go version.

## 🧪 Testing

Go has built-in support for unit testing. Once your functions are modularized, create a test file (e.g., `main_test.go`) and run:

```bash
go test
```
